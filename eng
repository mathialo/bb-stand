<p>Hello, and thank you for your response!</p>

<p>We are an ensamle of people who play together because it's fun, and we sure want you to join us!</p>

<p>We usually meet every Thursday at 19.00 in the basement of the physics buildning. We then play for 2ish hours. After rehersals we usually hang out, talk and enjoy life. </p>

<p>We have a couple of instruments you can borrow if you don't have your own</p>

<p>We begin our semester at Thursday, the 23rd of August a bit earlier than usual, at 18.30</p>

<p>We are hoping to see you at a rehersal!</p>

<p>Regards,<br>Biørneblæs</p>
